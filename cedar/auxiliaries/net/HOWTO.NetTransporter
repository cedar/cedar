SIMPLE USE CASES:
=================
(see a complete example at the end of the file)

I want to write data over the network:
--------------------------------------

#include <auxiliaries/net/NetWriter.h>

  cv::Mat mat= ...; // we will send this matrix over the network
  NetWriter<cv::Mat> writer("mychannel"); // this is our writer class

  // ...

  writer.write(mat);


I want to read the same data from the network:
----------------------------------------------

#include <auxiliaries/net/NetBlockingReader.h>
  
  cv::Mat mat;
  NetReader<cv::Mat> reader("mychannel");

  mat= reader.read();

  // Please make sure that your Writer and Reader use the same
  // 'channel'!


FAQ:
====

Question: What datatypes are supported?
---------------------------------------

As you can see the NetReaders and NetWriters are template classes. They
can only be used with variable types for which support has been programmed
in. These are at the moment:

  - int, char, short, long (all also unsigned), float, double, bool
  - cv::Mat
  - cv::Mat_<float> 
  - ... more to be added at your request ...


Question: How does the transport work?
--------------------------------------

The NetWriter/Readers use the YARP library internally, but are designed
to transparently wrap around YARP, so you don't need to worry about YARP.

Note, that if you will need an additional 'yarp server' started. It is
adviseable to have just one dedicated 'yarp server' running for your local
network, as conflicts may appera otherwise.

At the moment, we use mcast as network protocoll. Even for machine-local
transport. Note: Mcast ist a stateless protocoll, so messages may be lost.
This is a intentional trade-off.


Question: When does my data leave the machine/arrive?
-----------------------------------------------------

The NetWriter and NetReader are internally buffered, which means that
the read() and write() functions may(!) return before the data has actually
left the machine or may be buffered until you call read() to get the data.

The readers especially only have a buffer-size of one and will only
hold the newest arrived data.


Question: The 'channel's I define are not the ones I see YARP using
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to pass a 'channel'-name-string to the constructors of the
NetWriter/Reader. These are also called 'ports's in YARP nomenclature.

The NetWriter/Reader classes internally rename your 'channels', adding
prefixes and suffixes to administer the different dispersed readers that
listen to a YARP port.

YARP does internally resolve port naming conflicts (of Readers).


Question: What different types of readers are there:
----------------------------------------------------
The NetBlockingReader ... class blocks the execution of your code until
                      input arrives over its channel, while the ...
    NetReader         ... class (NetReader.h) does not block, 
                      but will throw an
                      NetUnexpectedDataException when there is no
                      data available. See below.


Question: What about exceptions:
--------------------------------
The readers may throw the following exceptions which you may want to
catch and react to in your code:

#include <auxiliaries/net/exceptions/NetException.h>

  NetUnexpectedDataException: Will be thrown when there was no data
      on the channel (for the non-blocking NetReader)
      OR some transmission error occurred. It signals you that the
      return value of read() is unuseable.
      You will want to catch this to write robust code.

  NetWaitingForWriterException: Will be thrown if you read the
      reader class before the (remote) writer class was instantiated
      (i.e. we cannot connect channels/ports yet).
      You will want to catch this to implement a polling behaviour to 
      wait for the writer channel.

Both reader and writer will throw:

  NetMissingRessourceException: Which will typically be thrown if 
      YARP could not be initialized properly.

A COMPLETE EXAMPLE:
===================

#include <auxiliaries/net/NetWriter.h>
#include <auxiliaries/net/NetBlockingReader.h>
#include <auxiliaries/net/exceptions/NetException.h>

using namespace cedar::aux::net;
using namespace cedar::aux::exc;

  // ...

  // instantiate reader class
  try 
  {
    NetReader<cv::Mat> reader("mychannel");
  }
  catch (NetMissingRessourceException &E)
  {
    // somehow YARP doesnt work ... :( typically fatal.
    exit(1);
  }

  // ...

  // read the data over the network
  while (1)
  {
    try
    {
      mat= reader.read(); // note: we don't use a blocking reader
    }
    catch (NetWaitingForWriterException &E) 
    {
      // wait for remote writer to be initialized ...
      sleep(2); // 2 seconds
      continue;
    }
    catch (NetUnexpectedDataException &E)
    {
      // invalid or corrupted data, ignore
      // OR no new valid data yet
      
      break; // mat is unuseable, mark it as such somehow in your code
    }
    catch (NetMissingRessourceException &E)
    {
      // somehow YARP doesnt work ... :( typically fatal.
      exit(1);
    }

    break; // mat holds the valid new result
  }
