== current version ==

- cedar::aux
  - fixed a critical bug in LoopedThread::singleStep, which used microseconds instead of milliseconds for step()

- cedar::proc
  - added directional arrows for graphical connections in processingIde
  - when loading a plugin, the PluginProxy now also looks for a plugin description file. This file may contain some
    information about your plugin in case you don't want to hardcode it, e.g., it can contain icon paths for processing
    steps. See documentation of cedar::proc::PluginDeclaration for details.
    
- processingIde
  - The IDE now remembers whether or not snap to grid is active.
  - Implemented zooming in the IDE; apart from the controls that are directly visible, scrolling is also possible with
    the mouse wheel (hold down ctrl)
  - The property pane now indicates when parameters have been changed since the last save. 
  - more verbose tooltip for data slots

== Version 0.5.1 ==
- cedar::proc::steps
  - fixed compilation bug of cedar::proc::steps::GaussInput on Windows platforms

== Version 0.5 ==

first release!
