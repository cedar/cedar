== current version ==

- cedar::proc
  - added directional arrows for graphical connections in processingIde
  - when loading a plugin, the PluginProxy now also looks for a plugin description file. This file may contain some
    information about your plugin in case you don't want to hardcode it, e.g., it can contain icon paths for processing
    steps. See documentation of cedar::proc::PluginDeclaration for details.
    
- processingIde
  - The IDE now remembers whether or not snap to grid is active.

== Version 0.5 ==

first release!
