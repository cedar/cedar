== stable release ==

Please keep in mind that "stable" refers to the state of our interfaces, i.e., doesn't mean the software is crash- or
bug-free, but rather, that we'll try to not change any signatures of functions without deprecating them first.

Currently, there are still a few classes and frameworks that are under development. Here's a list of interfaces that are
likely to undergo major changes:
- everything in devices
- everything in units
- the class CoordinateTransformation in processing::steps


== known issues ==
  - cedardyn is not properly loaded on some OSs when using processingIde. If you want to use its content, manually load
    cedardyn using the plugin dialog. You then may want to go to the Manage.. dialog and mark this plugin to be loaded
    on every start.
  - On windows, some of the GL drawing functionality for kinematic chains and related classes is not implemented.
  - Grouping steps into networks is buggy. Please use with caution and report any errors you encounter.
  - cedar::dev::sensors::visual::CameraGrabber is not working at the moment.
  - network functionality in the processing framework has several issues; for now, we recommend not using it because
    there are some annoying bugs related to it.

== current version ==

== Version 1.0.0 ==
- cedar::aux
  - The image plot, when clicked, now shows the value of the pixel under the cursor.
  
- cedar::proc
  - IMPORTANT: when connections are removed, the inputConnectionChanged method is now called (as should always have been
    the case); please test your steps accordingly and make sure you check whether the new data is not a null pointer!
  - You can now define plots in ElementDeclarations. Plots, in this case, are a list of data that is to be plotted
    together.
  - The resize step now orders its dimensions consistently in two-dimensional cases; unfortunately, this means that
    all old architectures will need to flip their size order (used to be [width, height], is now [height, width]).
  - Plot widgets now no longer dock in the processingIde!
  - Steps can now take care of locking their inputs and outputs manually by setting a flag. This may be useful if steps
    lock data for a long time even though they are not accessing it, potentially preventing other steps in the
    processing chain from running.
  - The processingIde can now export architectures into SVG files.

== Version 0.9.1 ==
- general
  - cedar now accepts both qwt versions 5.x and 6.x
- cedar::aux
  - added a slice plot for 3D matrix data
  - implemented full mode for the opencv convolution engine
  - removed the ConfigurationInterface (and the option to use CEDAR_LIBCONFIG_LEGACY_MODE)
  - FileParameters now can be set to have their path relative to the current working directory.
  - A new annotation system has been introduced. Because of this, ImageData is now deprecated and should be switched to
    MatData.
- cedar::dev
  - added MountedCameraViewer, simulating cameras fixed on a kinematic chain in OpenGL
- cedar::proc
  - added a processing step for convolutions
  - parameters are now locked in the compute method of processing steps
  - as a very first attempt to reduce clutter in larger architectures, steps now have display modes that can accessed
    and set via the right-click menu in the processingIde. 
  - interface change for cedar::proc::Connectable (raising the level of const-correctness):
    virtual cedar::proc::DataSlot::VALIDITY determineInputValidity
                                            (
                                              cedar::proc::ConstDataSlotPtr slot,
                                              cedar::aux::DataPtr data  // not const
                                            ) const;
    is now
    virtual cedar::proc::DataSlot::VALIDITY determineInputValidity
                                            (
                                              cedar::proc::ConstDataSlotPtr slot,
                                              cedar::aux::ConstDataPtr data // introduced ConstDataPtr here
                                            ) const;
  - cedar::aux::math::Sigmoid now inherits from cedar::aux::math::TransferFunction, with TransferFunction being
    a generalization of a sigmoid function (a mapping R -> R)
- build system
  - added a find script for FFTW that also searches for the include directory
  - added defines for the current cedar version; this makes it possible to stay compatible to older versions, should
    this ever be needed.
  - removed dependency on libconfig

== Version 0.9 ==
- cedar::aux
  - fixed a critical bug in LoopedThread::singleStep, which used microseconds instead of milliseconds for step()
  - cedar::aux::Configurable now inherits from boost::noncopyable, explicitly stating that you should never use
    the copy constructor. Instead, you should use the functions Configurable::copyTo and Configurable::copyFrom.
  - Templated functions in cedar::aux::math now have an "alias" version that can be called without a template parameter.
    This function automatically decides which template version to call based on the matrix types.
  - Added a function cedar::aux::System::locateResource that helps with finding cedar resources (i.e., config files
    etc.) independent of the current working directory. See the documentation for details.
  - the cedar::aux::Base class was removed
  - The old ConfigurationInterface is being phased out now. For this purpose, a transitional interface has been
    developed that should mostly work with the old code. If you run into trouble, add the following line to your
    cedar configuration file:
    set (CEDAR_LIBCONFIG_LEGACY_MODE      1           CACHE BOOL "Use libconfig legacy mode.")
    If you set this flag to 0, libconfig++ is no longer needed as a dependency! Some unit tests may fail, though.
  - merged AbstractFactory and AbstractFactoryDerived with Factory and FactoryDerived (including some changes to the
    interfaces)
  - introduced new FactoryManager class
  - gl::Object has been renamed to gl::RigidBody
  - There are some new Parameter types: ObjectListParameter and ObjectParameter. They allow dynamically selecting the
    type of one or more objects. For example, these allow to dynamically select the type of the Sigmoid as well as the
    combination of kernels in the neural field.
  - Added a new Log class to cedar::aux. Using this is the new standard logging mechanism (over std::cout), as it can be
    redirected at will, e.g., to the console (default) or some user interface. To access the log, use the corresponding
    cedar::aux::LogSingleton::getInstance(). See the Logging tutorial in the documentation or cedar::aux::Log.
  - There is a new widget for displaying log messages: cedar::aux::gui::Log.
  - NumericParameters (DoubleParameter, IntParameter, UIntParameter) no longer need minimum and maximum values. They
    also have a new constructor that takes a math::Limits object which is the new, recommended way of setting the
    limits. The same is true for NumericVectorParameters.
  - Added Data classes for stereo images and image sets.
  - There is now a generalized structure for convolution. This structure wraps opencv and, optionally, fftw convolution!
    For more, see the documentation for the cedar::aux::conv::Convolution class.
  - The net namespace was added. This namespace contains wrappers around yarp's functionality and is available if cedar
    is compiled with yarp.
    
- cedar::dev
  - Added several classes for grabbing pictures, videos and cameras in cedar::dev::sensors::visual.

- cedar::proc
  - added directional arrows for graphical connections in processingIde
  - when loading a plugin, the PluginProxy now also looks for a plugin description file. This file may contain some
    information about your plugin in case you don't want to hardcode it, e.g., it can contain icon paths for processing
    steps. See documentation of cedar::proc::PluginDeclaration for details.
  - Overhauled the plotting system. You can now select different types of plots for data in the processingIde where
    available.
  - added grouping functionality for processing
  - added promotion of data slots for networks
  - Some outputs and parameters have been renamed. If your architectures fail to load, check that the connections use
    the correct names.

- processingIde
  - The IDE now remembers whether or not snap to grid is active.
  - Implemented zooming in the IDE; apart from the controls that are directly visible, scrolling is also possible with
    the mouse wheel (hold down ctrl)
  - The property pane now indicates when parameters have been changed since the last save. 
  - more verbose tooltip for data slots
  - there is now a settings dialog; more settings will be added later.
  - the tab order in the property pane is now working correctly

- cedar::dyn
  - NeuralField now supports changing the sigmoid type, the number and type of kernel modes as well as dynamic exchange
    of the convolution method
    
- build system
  - Projects depending on cedar no longer need to define __LINUX__ etc.; this is now done automatically by the build
    system. 
  - files in the resource folder are now moved to ${CEDAR_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/resources. Use the
    cedar::aux::System::locateResource function to locate them.
  - It is no longer necessary to specify CEDAR_BUILD_DIR in the cedar.conf file. Instead, if the variable is not
    specified, the directory in which you call cmake is automatically selected.

== Version 0.5.1 ==
- cedar::proc::steps
  - fixed compilation bug of cedar::proc::steps::GaussInput on Windows platforms

== Version 0.5 ==

first release!
