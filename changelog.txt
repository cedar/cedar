== current version ==

- cedar::aux
  - fixed a critical bug in LoopedThread::singleStep, which used microseconds instead of milliseconds for step()
  - cedar::aux::Configurable now inherits from boost::noncopyable, explicitly stating that you should never use
    the copy constructor. Instead, you should use the functions Configurable::copyTo and Configurable::copyFrom.
  - Templated functions in cedar::aux::math now have an "alias" version that can be called without a template parameter.
    This function automatically decides which template version to call based on the matrix types.
  - Added a function cedar::aux::System::locateResource that helps with finding cedar resources (i.e., config files
    etc.) independent of the current working directory. See the documentation for details.
  - Added a new Log class to cedar::aux. Using this is the new standard logging mechanism (over std::cout), as it can be
    redirected at will, e.g., to the console (default) or some user interface. To access the log, use the corresponding
    cedar::aux::LogSingleton::getInstance().

- cedar::proc
  - added directional arrows for graphical connections in processingIde
  - when loading a plugin, the PluginProxy now also looks for a plugin description file. This file may contain some
    information about your plugin in case you don't want to hardcode it, e.g., it can contain icon paths for processing
    steps. See documentation of cedar::proc::PluginDeclaration for details.
    
- processingIde
  - The IDE now remembers whether or not snap to grid is active.
  - Implemented zooming in the IDE; apart from the controls that are directly visible, scrolling is also possible with
    the mouse wheel (hold down ctrl)
  - The property pane now indicates when parameters have been changed since the last save. 
  - more verbose tooltip for data slots
  - there is now a settings dialog; more settings will be added later.

== Version 0.5.1 ==
- cedar::proc::steps
  - fixed compilation bug of cedar::proc::steps::GaussInput on Windows platforms

== Version 0.5 ==

first release!
