Compattibilty Issues
====================

C0001 - Using a std class without including the header
------------------------------------------------------

On newer versions of clang/Mac OS, a STL implementation different from the one in gcc is used. Thus, some headers are no
longer included indirectly. In order to avoid compilation problems on Mac OS, all STL headers for used classes should be
included directly.

C0002 - Using boost::shared_dynamic_cast
----------------------------------------

This function was removed in newer boost versions. Its replacement is boost::dynamic_pointer_cast. shared_dynamic_cast
can be replaced by dynamic_pointer_cast directly without any other changes and works equivalently.

C0003 - Guarding boost includes
----------------------------------------

When using certain versions of Qt and boost, there is an incompatibility of certain macros defined in these libraries.
These are issues we cannot fix directly; instead, we need to work around them by guarding boost includes with
#ifndef Q_MOC_RUN. The correct version should look like this:

    #ifndef Q_MOC_RUN
        #include <boost/signals2/signal.hpp>
    #endif


Miscellaneous Issues
====================

M0002 & M0002 - Outdated copyright information
----------------------------------------------

All files should have all consecutive years since 2011 in their copyright header in a fixed format, e.g., Copyright
